# OpenMonkeyMind


*Plugins and extension for OpenSesame*

## About

OpenMonkeyMind (OMM) allows OpenSesame experiments to be managed on a central server ([omm-server](https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-server)) and deployed to computers running OpenSesame with the [omm-client](https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-client) software installed.

## Requirements

- [OpenSesame 4.1](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/)
- [OpenMonkeyMind server software](https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-server)


## Installation

You can install OpenMonkeyMind through PyPi/ pip:

```
pip install opensesame-extension-omm
```

Or through Anaconda (if you're running an Anaconda Python environment):

```
conda install opensesame-extension-omm -c cogsci -y
```

To run these commands in the OpenSesame console, you need to prefix them with `!`:

```
!conda install opensesame-extension-omm -c cogsci -y
```

Ubuntu users can also install OpenMonkeyMind through the Rapunzel PPA:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:smathot/rapunzel
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-opensesame-extension-omm
```

## Connecting to the OMM server

The easiest way to connect to an OMM server is through the OpenMonkeyMind extension (Menu → Tools → OpenMonkeyMind). This opens a basic configuration panel that specifies a few things:

- The __Server address__ and __port__ of the OMM server. An OMM server must be running, either locally on your own computer or somewhere else. If a server is detected, the checkmark next to the port will turn green.
- The __identification method__ that is used to announce participants.
  - The *keypress* method collects a single key press, which means that participant identifiers are limited to single characters.
  - The *form* method collects a multicharacter identifier through a text-input form.
  - The *rfid* method reads an identifier from an RFID chip (specific to Rousset).
- The __backend__, __display resolution__, and a __fullscreen__ option. These options will apply to all experiments running in the session.
- The __local log file__ is a file on the local system. Log data will be appended to this log file as one line of JSON data for every time that a `logger` is called. The `logger` also sends this data to the OMM server.
- The __fallback experiment__ is an experiment file on the local system that will be executed when the OMM server cannot be reached or when no jobs are lined up for the participant. The fallback experiment will be disconnected, i.e. the `omm.connected` property will be `False`.
- The __YAML data__ allows you to optionally specify experimental variables in the form of a YAML dictionary.

The green play button starts a session. If the YAML data is invalid or a server is not detected at the specified address and port, the button is disabled.

You can also open a template to create your own entry-point experiment for connecting to an OMM server. By default, the entry-point experiment first waits until a participant identifier is detected with the `OMMDetectParticipant` item. The `OMMAnnounce` item then sends this identifier to the OMM Server, which returns an experiment file that is subsequently started.


## Implementing an experiment for OMM

The easiest way to build a new OMM-compatible experiment is by first opening the OpenMonkeyMind extension (Menu → Tools → OpenMonkeyMind) and from there opening the template for a new experiment. In this template, most of the action happens in *trial_sequence*. This can be an arbitrary trial sequence, just like you're used to in regular OpenSesame experiments.


### Requesting a job from the OMM server

The `OMMRequestJob` item gets a job from the OMM server. Effectively, this sets an experimental variables for each column from the job table. In that sense, it is similar to what the *block_loop* would do in a regular OpenSesame experiment.

If the job contains the variables `_run` and/ or `_prepare` then those are assumed to contain Python code, which is executed during the Run or Prepare phase of the `OMMRequestJob` item.

By default, the next unfinished job will be retrieved. That is, the job table will be consumed from top to bottom. You can also specify a specific job index. This is mostly useful if you want to constrain the order in which jobs are executed.

If you want to test the experiment by running it directly (i.e. without being connected to an OMM server), then you can indicate a 'Loop for testing'. In that case, a job will be emulated by randomly selecting a row from the `loop` table.

The following variables are set automatically:

- `omm_job_index` indicates the position of the job in the job table, where the first job is at index 1.
- `omm_job_count` indicates the number of jobs in the table.
- `omm_job_id` indicates a unique identifier for the job. This identifier is different from `omm_job_index` because it does not indicate the position of the job in the job table.


### Sending job results to the OMM server

You can use a regular `logger` item to send job results (i.e. experimental variables) to the OMM server. (This works because the entry-point experiment installs a special log backend.) In addition to being sent to the server, the job results are also appended in `json` format to the log file that you have indicated when starting the entry-point experiment.


### Seed dispenser

The `OMMConditioner` item allows for dispensing seed rewards (specific to Rousset).


## The `omm` Python object

The `omm` object is added to the Python workspace automatically when an experiment is executed by an entry point; in this case the `omm.connected` property is `True`. Otherwise, the `omm` object is added to the workspace during the prepare phase of the first OMM plug-in in the experiment; in this case, the `omm.connected` property is `False`. Therefore, if you want to use the `omm` object in an `inline_script`, the safest way to do this is to check whether it exists and is connected, like so:

~~~python
if 'omm' in globals() and omm.connected:
    print('Connected to an OMM server')
else:
    print('Not connected to an OMM server')
~~~
